# Simulator
This is an attempt at writing a simple robot simulator that can run the code we run on the robot.  
The reason behind this is that we want to be able to see what we are doing earlier in the season, before we have a working robot.

## Instructions
Clone the project, import into intellij, and run 
```Bash
./gradlew run 
```

Right now this is a proof of concept, but eventually we would like to simulate a whole game.  It would also be nice to write tests 
for things like autonomous, so we know where we are ending up.
